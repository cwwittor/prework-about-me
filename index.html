      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Christian and I am currently a student at North Carolina State University who will be graduating in a few days. I enjoy spending time: playing games, running, watching anime, keeping up with the NBA, watching Twitch, and talking/hanging out with friends.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Hampstead, North Carolina, but I have also spent a fair amount of my time in both Raleigh NC and Wilmington, NC.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are probably the discussion of anime with friends, watching livestreamers such as Ludwig and Hasan on twitch.tv, talking about and watching the NBA with friends, playing video games, and making sure that I do my daily workouts which include running 2 miles daily.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is a little embarassing since I don't know specifically what specific job title I would like to have but something to where I feel secure and happy with the work I do is probably a nice start.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Wilmington, North Carolina.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because the coding classes at NCSU were the only classes that I got significant fulfillment and enjoyment out of aside from maybe some PE classes or the odd mixed bag course.</p>
